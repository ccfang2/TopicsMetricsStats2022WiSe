# Topics in Metrics and Stats, 2022 Winter Semester

> Chencheng Fang

This repository contains all materials I created for the presentation at this topic course. I presented [Rambachan and Roth (2022)](), which provides two ways (Conditional and Hybrid Method; Fixed Length Confidence Intervals) to handle with the case in DiD when parallel trends are violated.

## Presentation

Slides can be downloaded from [here](raw.githubusercontent.com/ccfang2/TopicsMetricsStats2022WiSe/main/final_presentation_WiSe.md), or be viewed directly on Github [here](https://github.com/ccfang2/TopicsMetricsStats2022WiSe/blob/main/final_presentation_WiSe.md).

## Simulation

Simulation code and results are in folder 'SimHonestDiD'.

## Shiny App

Shiny App code is in folder 'RRSensitivityTest'.
